We encourage you being part of the Keptn community by joining discussions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/keptnProject), [Slack](https://slack.keptn.sh), and our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/keptn). Besides, there are four pillars for Keptn community rockstar to excel at.


### Show excellence!

  💻 **Development**: Creation of an extension either in the [Keptn Contrib](https://github.com/keptn-contrib) or [Keptn Sandbox](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox) organization or contribution to the [Keptn core](https://github.com/keptn/keptn).

  🔈 **Presentation**: Publicly talk about and present Keptn at a meetup/podcast/conference or similar formats - we are happy to [add your contribution here](https://github.com/keptn/community/blob/master/resources.md).

  🧑‍🏫 **Education**: Educate others on Keptn by either [writing a tutorial](https://github.com/keptn/tutorials), giving a workshop on how to use Keptn or similar formats.

  📈 **Growth**: Bring other people to the Keptn community by inviting them to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/keptnProject), [Slack](https://slack.keptn.sh), and our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/keptn).

### Get nominated!

If you get nominated by someone from the Keptn community and your name is brought forward to the [community leads](https://github.com/keptn/community/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) (you will also find them in [Slack](https://slack.keptn.sh)), they will evaluate based on the mentioned dimensions and eventually reward a member of the Keptn community each quarter for his outstanding contributions!
