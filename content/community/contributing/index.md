We are welcoming new contributors to the Keptn project!

## Getting started

**1Ô∏è.** If you are new to Keptn and want to get started contributing, please take a look at our [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file that lays out the process on how to contribute to the project.

**2Ô∏è.** We curate a list of [**good first issues**](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) which are suitable for first-time contributors as they do not require in-depth knowledge of our project. If you find a good first issue, please comment on it and a Keptn maintainer will be happy to assign it to you.

**3Ô∏è.** Once you have finished implementing your feature or bug fix, please consider [**presenting it in a Keptn developer meeting**](./meetings/) to let the Keptn community know and celebrate your achievement! 

## Keptn integrations

If you want to contribute an **integration** to Keptn, please take a look at the [**Keptn Sandbox**](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/contributing), which is the starting point for Keptn integrations.

üí° Did you know that there is a [**template to get started with new integrations**](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/keptn-service-template-go)? The Keptn team is maitaining it as a good first start and skeleton for new Keptn integrations. It is written in Golang. But feel free to submit your contribution in other languages as well.
