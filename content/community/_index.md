## Slack

We have a dedicated [Keptn slack workspace](https://slack.keptn.sh) (for in-depth discussions and getting in touch with the team) as well as a #keptn channel in the [CNCF Slack workspace](http://slack.cncf.io/). We are happy to talk to you!

✅ Chat with other people about using Keptn

✅ Connect to other Keptn developers to start your own Keptn integration

✅ Get help from the Keptn community

❌ This is not a good place to submit bug reports 🐞 . Please [open an issue](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues) instead so the Keptn maintainers & developers can take care of it.

## Meetings

We are hosting monthly [Keptn user groups](./meetings/) and regular community and developer [meetings](./meetings/) every two weeks.
All these meetings happen in the APAC/EMEA and Americas/EMEA timezones,

All meetings are public, any Keptn contributor or user are welcome to join!
Find the details in the corresponding sections.
