👋 **Welcome to the Keptn community!**

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the Keptn community - improving docs, improving code, discussing new features and use cases etc. For all collaboration and communication going on in all keptn projects, please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/keptn/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Slack

We have a dedicated [Keptn slack workspace](https://slack.keptn.sh) (for in-depth discussions and getting in touch with the team) as well as a #keptn channel in the [CNCF Slack workspace](http://slack.cncf.io/). We are happy to talk to you!

✅ Chat with other people about using Keptn

✅ Connect to other Keptn developers to start your own Keptn integration

✅ Get help from the Keptn community

❌ This is not a good place to submit bug reports 🐞 . Please [open an issue](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues) instead so the Keptn maintainers & developers can take care of it.

## Meetings

We are hosting monthly [Keptn user groups](./meetings/) and regular community and developer [meetings](./meetings/) every two weeks.
All these meetings happen in the APAC/EMEA and Americas/EMEA timezones,
approximately at 8..10AM and 3..5PM UTC.

All meetings are public, any Keptn contributor or user are welcome to join!
Find the details in the corresponding sections.

## Community Portal

The Keptn community has a chapter on the [CNCF Community Portal](https://community.cncf.io/keptn-community/).
This chapter is used for Keptn meetings and other events hosted by the community.
Please join the chapter and register for the events!

✅ Watch for new releases of Keptn
