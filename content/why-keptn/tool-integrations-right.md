## Micro-service based tool integrations avoiding lock-in

Keptn integrations translate well-defined CloudEvents into proprietary vendor APIs and hide complex automation for advanced tasks. 

This makes exchanging tools a simple configuration change rather than touching each individual pipeline. This means that you can use Keptn to orchestrate any tools you like, for more information about integrating tools , check out [Keptn and other tools](https://keptn.sh/docs/concepts/keptn-tools/).
