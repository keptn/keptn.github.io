## Separation of concerns for higher compliance

Keptn separates the process defined by SREs from the actual tooling defined by DevOps engineers and the information about the artifacts.

These definitions can be managed independently compared to traditional pipelines where everything is stored in a single file. This ensures that people cannot mistakenly brake workflows and as they are managed in Git you will also have a full history of changes.
