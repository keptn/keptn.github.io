## Affected

Keptn jmeter-service in version 0.11.3 and older.

## Description

Keptn jmeter-service in version 0.11.3 and older includes JMeter with a version below v5.4.2 that is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution due to the embedded Log4j version. More details about the vulnerability of Log4j can be found in [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) and [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046). With JMeter v5.4.2 the bug is fixed ([changelog](https://jmeter.apache.org/changes.html)).

We believe that this issue can be exploited in a Keptn execution plane to some conditions.

## Severity

The severity of the vulnerability of jmeter-service is: 

**Overall CVSS Score: 4.0** and **CVSS v3.1 Vector**: `AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L/E:U/RL:O/RC:R/CR:L/IR:L/AR:L/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:L/MUI:N/MS:U/MC:L/MI:L/MA:L`

*Note*: The calculation of the CVSS is based on a Keptn 0.11 installation. 

## Recommendations

The release of **jmeter-service** in version **0.11.4** contains the new JMeter version v5.4.2. We recommend upgrading your Keptn control plane to 0.11.x as soon as possible allowing you to upgrade the **jmeter-service** to version **0.11.4**.

* :warning: When running on a Keptn below 0.11, you have to perform a backup of the MongoDB due to a breaking change in 0.11. Please follow this [upgrade path with manual MongoDB backup/restore](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.11.x/operate/upgrade/#upgrade-from-keptn-0-10-x-to-0-11-x).
* When running on Keptn 0.11.x, please follow this [upgrade path](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.11.x/operate/upgrade/#upgrade-from-keptn-0-11-x-to-keptn-0-11-4).

## Workaround

* Ensure the jmeter-service is not accessible from outside the execution plane.
* Protect all branches of your Git repository managed by Keptn; especially for unauthorized file changes of `jmx` files in the `jmeter` folder on the branches.
