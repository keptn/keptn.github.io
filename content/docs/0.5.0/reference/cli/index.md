In this section, the functionality and commands of the Keptn CLI are described. The Keptn CLI allows installing, configuring, and
uninstalling Keptn. Furthermore, the CLI allows creating projects, onboarding services, and sending new artifact events.

## Prerequisites
- All prerequisites from the [setup](../../installation/setup-keptn#prerequisites) are needed.

## Install the Keptn CLI
Every release of Keptn provides binaries for the Keptn CLI. These binaries are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

1. Download the [version matching your operating system](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/releases/)
1. Unpack the download
1. Find the `keptn` binary in the unpacked directory.
  - Linux / macOS
    
    add executable permissions (``chmod +x keptn``), and move it to the desired destination (e.g. `mv keptn /usr/local/bin/keptn`)

  - Windows

    move/copy the executable to the desired folder and, optionally, add the executable to the PATH environment variable for a more convenient experience.

4. Now, the Keptn CLI help can be shown by: 
    ```console
    keptn --help
    ```

## Start using the Keptn CLI

In the following, the commands provided by the Keptn CLI are described.
All of these commands provide a help flag (`--help`), which describes details of the respective command (e.g., usage of the command or description of flags).

**Note:** In the current version, Keptn is missing checks whether the sent command is executed correctly.
In order to guarantee the expected behavior, please strictly use the following commands in the specified order.
In future releases, we add additional checks whether the executed commands succeeded or failed.

### keptn install 

The Keptn CLI allows to install Keptn on an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS), an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS),
a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and on OpenShift.

- **AKS**:

    ```console
    keptn install --platform=aks
    ```
- **EKS**:

    ```console
    keptn install --platform=eks
    ```

- **GKE**:

    ```console
    keptn install --platform=gke
    ```

- **PKS**:

    ```console
    keptn install --platform=pks
    ```

- **OpenShift**:

    ```console
    keptn install --platform=openshift
    ```

### keptn configure domain

The Keptn CLI allows to configure a custom domain. This is mandatory if *xip.io* cannot be used (e.g., when running Keptn on EKS, AWS will create an ELB).

**Note:** This command requires a *kubernetes current context* pointing to the cluster where you would like to configure your domain. After installing Keptn this is guaranteed.

```console
keptn configure domain YOUR.CUSTOM.DOMAIN
```

### keptn auth 

Before the keptn CLI can be used, it needs to be authenticated against a keptn cluster. Therefore, an endpoint and an API token are required.

If the authentication is successful, keptn will inform the user and the endpoint as well as the API token are stored in a password store of the underlying operating system. More precisely, the keptn CLI stores the endpoint and API token using `pass` in case of Linux, using `Keychain` in case of macOS, or `Wincred` in case of Windows.

<details><summary>For Linux / macOS</summary>
<p>

Set the needed environment variables.

```console
KEPTN_ENDPOINT=https://api.keptn.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -ojsonpath={.data.app_domain})
KEPTN_API_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret keptn-api-token -n keptn -ojsonpath={.data.keptn-api-token} | base64 --decode)
```

Authenticate to the Keptn cluster.

```console
keptn auth --endpoint=$KEPTN_ENDPOINT --api-token=$KEPTN_API_TOKEN
```

**Note**: If you receive a warning `Using a file-based storage for the key because the password-store seems to be not set up.` this is because a password store could not be found in your environment. In this case, the credentials are stored in `~/.keptn/.password-store` in your home directory.
</p>

<details><summary>For Windows</summary>
<p>

Please expand the corresponding section matching your CLI tool.

<details><summary>PowerShell</summary>
<p>

For the Windows PowerShell, a small script is provided that installs the `PSYaml` module and sets the environment variables. Please note that the PowerShell might have to be started with **Run as Administrator** privileges to install the module.

1. Copy the following snippet and paste it in the PowerShell. The snippet will be automatically executed line by line.

    ```
    $tokenEncoded = $(kubectl get secret keptn-api-token -n keptn -ojsonpath='{.data.keptn-api-token}')
    $Env:KEPTN_API_TOKEN = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($tokenEncoded))
    $Env:KEPTN_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.keptn.'+$(kubectl get cm -n keptn keptn-domain -ojsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
    ```

1. Now that everything we need is stored in environment variables, we can proceed with authorizing the Keptn CLI. To authenticate against the Keptn cluster, use the `auth` command with the Keptn endpoint and API token:

    ```
    keptn.exe auth --endpoint=$Env:KEPTN_ENDPOINT --api-token=$Env:KEPTN_API_TOKEN
    ```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Command Line</summary>
<p>

In the Windows Command Line, a couple of steps are necessary.

1. Get the Keptn API Token encoded in base64

    ```console
    kubectl get secret keptn-api-token -n keptn -ojsonpath={.data.keptn-api-token}
    ```

    ```console
    abcdefghijkladfaea
    ```

1. Take the encoded API token - it is the value from the key `keptn-api-token` (in this example, it is `abcdefghijkladfaea`) and save it in a text file, e.g., `keptn-api-token-base64.txt`

1. Decode the file

    ```
    certutil -decode keptn-api-token-base64.txt keptn-api-token.txt
    ```

1. Open the newly created file `keptn-api-token.txt`, copy the value and paste it into the next command

    ```
    set KEPTN_API_TOKEN=keptn-api-token
    ```

1. Get the Keptn cluster endpoint 

    ```console
    kubectl get cm -n keptn keptn-domain -ojsonpath={.data.app_domain}
    ```

    ```console
    YOUR.DOMAIN
    ```

1. Copy the `domain` value and save it in an environment variable

    ```
    set KEPTN_ENDPOINT=https://api.keptn.YOUR.DOMAIN
    ```

1. Now that everything we need is stored in environment variables, we can proceed with authorizing the Keptn CLI.

    To authenticate against the Keptn cluster, use the `auth` command with the Keptn endpoint and API token:

    ```
    keptn.exe auth --endpoint=KEPTN_ENDPOINT --api-token=KEPTN_API_TOKEN
    ```

### keptn create project 

* **Option A:** Create a project without Git upstream: 

    To create a new project, use the command `create project` and specify at least the name of the project as well as the `shipyard.yaml` file (`--shipyard`) . Learn here more about [writing a shipyard file](../../manage/project/#create-a-project). 

    ```console
    keptn create project PROJECTNAME --shipyard=FILEPATH
    ```

* **Option B:** Create a project using a Git upstream: 

    By executing the `create project` command, Keptn initializes an internal Git repository that is used to maintain all project-related resources. To upstream this internal Git repository to a remote repository, the Git user (`--git-user`), an access token (`--git-token`), and the remote URL (`--git-remote-url`) are required. If you miss one of the requirements, go to [select Git-based upstream](../../manage/project/#select-git-based-upstream) where instructions for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are provided.

    ```console
    keptn create project PROJECTNAME --shipyard=FILEPATH --git-user=GIT_USER --git-token=GIT_TOKEN --git-remote-url=GIT_REMOTE_URL
    ```

### keptn delete project

To delete a project, use the command `delete project` and specify the project name.

```console
keptn delete project PROJECTNAME
```

**Note:** If a Git upstream is configured for this project, the referenced repository or project will not be deleted. Besides, deployed services are also not deleted by this command. 

### keptn onboard service

To onboard a service, use the command `onboard service` and provide the service name, project name (`--project` flag), and the root directory of a Helm chart (`--chart` flag). 

```console
keptn onboard service SERVICENAME --project=PROJECTNAME --chart=FILEPATH
```

If an archived Helm chart is already available, the archive with ending `.tgz` can be referenced. In this case, the Helm chart will be stored unpacked. 

```console
keptn onboard service SERVICENAME --project=PROJECTNAME --chart=HELM_CHART.tgz
```

To learn more about onboarding a service, please see the [Onboarding a Service](../../usecases/onboard-carts-service) tutorial.

### keptn add-resource

To add a resource to the configuration store (i.e., Git repository) of a service, the `add-resource` command is provided. This command takes a local resource (`--resource`) and stores it for further use in Keptn. Thus, this command allows adding, for example, *test files* to a service, which will then be executed by a test-service (e.g., jmeter-service) during the continuous delivery.  

```console
keptn add-resource --project=PROJECTNAME --stage=STAGE --service=SERVICENAME --resource=jmeter/basiccheck.jmx
```

### keptn configure monitoring

To configure a monitoring solution for a Keptn cluster, the `configure monitoring` command is provided. This command sets up monotoring in case it is not installed yet. Afterwards, the command configures the monitoring solution for a service based on the provided service indicators (`--service-indicators`), and service objectives (`--service-objectives`). The currently supported monitoring solution is *Prometheus*, as shown below:

```console
keptn configure monitoring prometheus --project=PROJECTNAME --service=SERVICENAME --service-indicators=service-indicators.yaml --service-objectives=service-objectives.yaml --remediation=remediation.yaml
```

### keptn send event new-artifact

After onboarding a service, the Keptn CLI allows to trigger the deployment of an artifact.
This artifact is a Docker image, which can be located at Docker Hub, Quay, or any other container registry which is accessible from within the cluster. The new artifact is pushed in the first stage specified in the `shipyard.yaml` file (usually this will be the dev stage). Afterwards, Keptn takes care of deploying this new artifact to the other stages.

For notifying Keptn to deploy a new artifact for a service, use the command `send event new-artifact`.
The CLI sends a new-artifact-event containing the image name and tag (not the image itself) to Keptn and then Keptn takes care
of deploying this new artifact.
This command takes the project (`--project`), the service (`--service`), as well as the image (`--image`) and tag (`--tag`) of the new artifact.

```console
keptn send event new-artifact --project=PROJECTNAME --service=SERVICENAME --image=docker.io/keptnexamples/carts --tag=0.9.1
```

**Note:** This command does not send the Docker image to Keptn. Instead, Keptn uses Kubernetes functionalities for pulling this image.
Therefore, the used Docker registry has to be accessible from your cluster. For pulling an image from a private registry,
we would like to refer to the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/).
Furthermore, please note that the value provided in the `image` flag has to contain your Docker registry. The only exception is `docker.io` because
this is the default in Kubernetes and, hence, can be omitted (e.g., `--image=docker.io/mongo` is the same as `--image=mongo`).

### keptn send event

To send an arbitrary Keptn event the `send event` command is provided. An event has to follow the [Cloud Events](https://cloudevents.io/) specification in version 0.2 and has to be written in JSON. Then the event can be passed in by referencing the JSON file (`--file`). Additionally, this command offers the `--stream-websocket` flag to open a web socket communication to Keptn. Consequently, messages from the receiving Keptn service, which processes the event, are sent to the CLI via websocket.

**Note:** This command requires precise Keptn event definitions as defined find [here](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/blob/0.5.0/specification/cloudevents.md).

```console
keptn send event --file=FILEPATH --stream-websocket
```

### keptn version

To show the current version of the Keptn CLI, the `version` command is provided.

```console
keptn version
```

### keptn uninstall

To uninstall Keptn from a cluster, the `uninstall` command is provided. 

This command does *not* delete: 

* Istio
* Tiller 
* Dynatrace monitoring
* Prometheus monitoring

Besides, deployed services and the configuration on the Git upstream (i.e., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) are not deleted. To clean-up created projects and services, instructions are provided [here](../../manage/project#delete-a-project).

**Note:** This command requires a *kubernetes current context* pointing to the cluster where Keptn should get uninstalled.

```console
keptn uninstall
```
