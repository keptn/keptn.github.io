## Organization of the Roadmap

In Keptn, the roadmap is organized based on *Keptn Enhancements Proposals* ([KEP](https://github.com/keptn/enhancement-proposals#keptn-enhancement-proposals)) that are mapped to Keptn releases. A KEP describes a value increment for driving the direction of the Keptn project. A KEP is open for discussion and once accepted it is broken down into implementation issues. These issues are then added to a milestone and delivered by Keptn releases.

## How can I contribute to the Roadmap?

* Feel free to start discussing KEPs that are already planned and put on the roadmap. 
* Feel free to file a new KEP to tell us the value increment you would like to have in Keptn: Instructions therefore are provided [here](https://github.com/keptn/enhancement-proposals#writing-a-new-proposal)
