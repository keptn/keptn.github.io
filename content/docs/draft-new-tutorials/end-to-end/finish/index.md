## 🎉 Congratulations 🎉
You have used Keptn to build a fortified end-to-end delivery orchestration whilst avoiding tool and vendor lock in.

The delivery orchestration you have built:

1. Uses the tooling you already know and love and allows tool changes by changing a few lines of code
3. Is tool and task unopinionated. Use any tasks and tools you wish
4. Prevents bad code, automatically stopping deployments if quality checks fail.
5. Can accomodate manual approvals if required
6. Can self-heal by taking actions using a flexible action + action provider format

### So What Next?

[Deploy Keptn properly](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.16.x/operate/install/) on your cluster to free your SRE and DevOps teams from toil.

Need help? Ask in the [Keptn Slack channel](https://slack.keptn.sh)

It is almost guaranteed that Keptn works with your tool. Want to know if someone has gone before you? See all [publicly documented integrations here](https://keptn.sh/docs/integrations).

Want to suggest (or submit) a new tooling integration that Keptn could / should work with? [Ask for it or submit it here](https://github.com/keptn/integrations/issues).
