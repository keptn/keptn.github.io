In order to evaluate the quality gates, we have to set up monitoring to provide the needed data. The setup provided in this documentation is specific to the carts service that is used throughout all use cases. This requires that the created project is called *sockshop* and the service is called *carts* as described in the use case [onboarding a service](../onboard-carts-service).

## Setup Prometheus

1. Checkout the needed files.

    - If you have not yet onboarded the carts service, please execute the following commands to receive the needed files:
    
    ```
    git clone --branch 0.4.1 https://github.com/keptn/examples.git --single-branch
    cd ./examples/monitoring/prometheus
    ```

    - If you already have [onboarded the carts service](../../usecases/onboard-carts-service/), navigate to the directory `monitoring/prometheus`. 

1. In this directory, you will find a script called `deployPrometheus.sh`. This script will deploy Prometheus in the namespace `monitoring` and set up scrape job configurations for monitoring the carts service in the `dev`, `staging`, and `production` namespace. Execute that script by calling:

  ```console
  ./deployPrometheus.sh
  ```

  ```console
  namespace "monitoring" created
  configmap "prometheus-server-conf" created
  clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "prometheus" created
  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "prometheus" created
  deployment.extensions "prometheus-deployment" created
  service "prometheus-service" created
  ```

To verify the Prometheus installation, you can browse to the Prometheus web interface:

1. Enable port-forwarding for the `prometheus-service`:

  ```console
  kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-service 8080 -n monitoring
  ```

1. Open the URL [localhost:8080/targets](http://localhost:8080/targets) in your browser. Here you should see three targets for the carts service:

      caption="Prometheus Targets">}}

    Please note that if you have not onboarded the carts service yet, the Prometheus dashboard will report _down_ in the state column.

## Uninstall Prometheus


If you want to uninstall Prometheus, there are scripts provided to do so. Uninstalling keptn will not automatically uninstall Prometheus.

1. (Optional) If you do not have the *examples* repository, clone the latest release using:

  ```console
  git clone --branch 0.4.1 https://github.com/keptn/examples.git --single-branch
  ```

1. Go to correct folder and execute the uninstallPrometheus.sh script:

  ```console
  cd examples/monitoring/prometheus
  ./uninstallPrometheus.sh
  ```
