Note: Keptn v1 is not compatible with ARM-based machines (eg. Mac M1 and M2) due to the use of the Bitnami MongoDB which isn't built for ARM. We recommend the newer [Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit](https://lifecycle.keptn.sh) instead.

The steps to install and configure your Keptn instance are:

1. [Create or bring a Kubernetes cluster](k8s/)
    * Check [Kubernetes support and cluster size](k8s-support/)
    to ensure that your version of Kubernetes is compatible
    with the Keptn version you are installing
    and that you have adequate resources.

2. Decide [how you want to access Keptn](access/).
   Kubernetes supports exposing Keptn via a LoadBalancer, a NodePort, an Ingress
   or using a Port-forward.

3. Install [Keptn CLI](cli-install/) on the cloud shell machine
   that is used to access your cloud provider, Kubernetes cluster, etc (recommended).

4. Install the [Helm CLI](https://helm.sh).

5. Install Keptn using a [Helm chart](helm-install/)
    * All on one cluster
    * Install using a [Multi-cluster setup](multi-cluster/),
    meaning that the Keptn Control Plane is installed in one Kubernetes cluster
    and the Keptn Execution Plane is installed in one or more other Kubernetes clusters.

5. [Authenticate CLI and Bridge](authenticate-cli-bridge/)

6. Install software to run Keptn tasks
    * [Job Executor Service](https://github.com/keptn-contrib/job-executor-service/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md)
        * The [Job Executor Service](https://github.com/keptn-contrib/job-executor-service)
         runs Keptn customizable tasks as Kubernetes jobs.
         See [Job Executor Service Features](https://github.com/keptn-contrib/job-executor-service/blob/main/docs/FEATURES.md) for more details.
        * Also see [Job Executor Service Architecture](https://github.com/keptn-contrib/job-executor-service/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#example-configuration)
    * [Istio](istio/)

7. If you are using [Quality Gates](../concepts/quality_gates/),
   install the [monitoring service](monitoring/) you want to use.

8. Configure [webhooks](webhook_service/) (optional)

9. If you have problems with your installation,
   check out the hints in [Troubleshooting the installation](troubleshooting/)
