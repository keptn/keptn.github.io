Keptn is installed using a Helm chart using the Helm CLI.
You must install the [Helm CLI](https://helm.sh)
and the [Keptn CLI](../cli-install)
before attempting to install Keptn.

After installing Keptn,
you must [authenticate the Keptn CLI](../authenticate-cli-bridge/#authenticate-keptn-cli). 

Keptn consists of a **Control Plane** and an **Execution Plane**.

* The **Control Plane** allows using Keptn for the [Quality Gates](../../concepts/quality_gates/)
  and [Automated Operations](../../concepts/automated_operations/).
  The Keptn Control Plane can run with no Execution Plane configured.
* The **Control Plane with the Execution Plane** is required to implement
  [Continuous Delivery](../../concepts/delivery/)
  on top of Quality Gates and Automated Operations..
  * Note that you must install either the
  [Job Executor Service](https://artifacthub.io/packages/keptn/keptn-integrations/job-executor-service)
  or [Istio](https://istio.io) on the Kubernetes cluster(s) where the Execution Plane is installed.

See [Architecture](../../concepts/architecture) for more information
about the Control Plane and the Execution Plane.

Keptn can be installed on an existing Kubernetes cluster that hosts other software
or on a dedicated Keptn Kubernetes cluster.
The Control Plane and Execution Plane can also be installed on separate Kubernetes clusters;
see [Multi-cluster setup](../multi-cluster) for instructions.
* In a multi-cluster setup, one Keptn Control Plane can support multiple Execution Planes
that are installed on different clusters.

## Control Plane installation options

You must specify the [access option](../access) when you install
the Keptn Control Plane.

* Install Keptn control-plane with Continuous Delivery support and exposed on a [LoadBalancer](../access/#option-1-expose-keptn-via-a-loadbalancer):

```
helm install keptn keptn --version 0.18.1 -n keptn --repo=https://charts.keptn.sh --create-namespace --wait --set=continuousDelivery.enabled=true,apiGatewayNginx.type=LoadBalancer
```

* Use a LoadBalancer for api-gateway-nginx

```console
helm upgrade keptn keptn --install -n keptn --create-namespace --wait --version=0.18.1 --repo=https://charts.keptn.sh --set=apiGatewayNginx.type=LoadBalancer
```

* Install Keptn with an ingress object

  If you are already using an [Ingress Controller](../access/#option-3-expose-keptn-via-an-ingress)
  and want to create an ingress object for Keptn,
  you can leverage the ingress section of the Helm chart. By default `enabled` is set to false.

  The Helm chart allows customizing the ingress object to your needs.
  When `enabled` is set to `true`, the chart allows you to specify optional parameters
  of host, path, pathType, tls, and annotations.
  This supports many different Ingress-Controllers and configurations.

  ```console
  helm upgrade keptn keptn --install -n keptn --create-namespace
  --set=ingress.enabled=true,
       ingress.annotations=<YOUR_ANNOTATIONS>,
       ingress.host=<YOUR_HOST>,
       ingress.path=<YOUR_PATH>,
       ingress.pathType=<YOUR_PATH_TYPE>,  
       ingress.tls=<YOUR_TLS>
  ```

## Install Keptn execution-plane:

```
helm install jmeter-service https://github.com/keptn/keptn/releases/download/0.18.1/jmeter-service-0.18.1.tgz -n keptn --create-namespace --wait

helm install helm-service https://github.com/keptn/keptn/releases/download/0.18.1/helm-service-0.18.1.tgz -n keptn --create-namespace --wait
```

## The --set flag

The `helm install` and `helm upgrade` commands offer a flag called `--set`,
which can be used to specify several configuration options using the format `key1=value1,key2=value2,...`.
The full list of available flags can be found
in the [helm-charts](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/tree/master/installer/manifests/keptn).

* The **Control Plane with the Execution Plane (for Continuous Delivery)**
can be installed by the following command:
```console
helm upgrade keptn keptn --install -n keptn --create-namespace --wait --version=0.18.1 --repo=https://charts.keptn.sh --set=continuousDelivery.enabled=true
```

* The **Control Plane with the Execution Plane (for Continuous Delivery)** and a `LoadBalancer` for exposing Keptn can be installed by the following command:
```console
helm upgrade keptn keptn --install -n keptn --create-namespace --wait --version=0.18.1 --repo=https://charts.keptn.sh --set=continuousDelivery.enabled=true,apiGatewayNginx.type=LoadBalancer
```

### Install Keptn using a user-provided API token

You can provide your own API token for Keptn to use by setting the secret name
in the `apiService.tokenSecretName` Helm value during installation.
For Helm-Service and JMeter-Service,
you can also provide the API token by using the `remoteControlPlane.tokenSecretName` Helm value.

The user-provided secret needs to live in the same namespace where Keptn will be installed.
The user-provided secret should contain a single key `keptn-api-token`
with a token consisting of numbers and letters as its value.

### Execute Helm upgrade without Internet connectivity

The following section contains instructions for installing Keptn in an air-gapped / offline installation scenario.

The following artifacts must be available locally:

* Keptn Helm Chart (control-plane + helm + jmeter)
* Several Docker Images (e.g., pushed into a private registry)
* Helper scripts
* Keptn CLI (optional, but recommended for future use)

**Download Keptn Helm Charts**

Download the Helm charts from the [Keptn 0.18.x release](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/releases/tag/0.18.1):

* Keptn Control Plane: https://github.com/keptn/keptn/releases/download/0.18.1/keptn-0.18.1.tgz
* helm-service (if needed): https://github.com/keptn/keptn/releases/download/0.18.1/helm-service-0.18.1.tgz
* jmeter-service (if needed): https://github.com/keptn/keptn/releases/download/0.18.1/jmeter-service-0.18.1.tgz

Move the Helm Charts to a directory on your local machine, e.g., `offline-keptn`.

For convenience, the following script creates this directory and downloads the required Helm Charts into it:

```console
mkdir offline-keptn
cd offline-keptn
curl -L https://github.com/keptn/keptn/releases/download/0.18.1/keptn-0.18.1.tgz -o keptn-0.18.1.tgz
curl -L https://github.com/keptn/keptn/releases/download/0.18.1/helm-service-0.18.1.tgz -o helm-service-0.18.1.tgz
curl -L https://github.com/keptn/keptn/releases/download/0.18.1/jmeter-service-0.18.1.tgz -o jmeter-service-0.18.1.tgz
cd ..
```

**Download Containers/Images**

Within the Helm Charts several Docker Images are referenced (Keptn specific and some third party dependencies).
We recommend pulling, re-tagging and pushing those images to a local registry that the Kubernetes cluster can reach.

A helper script is provided for this in our Git repository: https://github.com/keptn/keptn/blob/master/installer/airgapped/pull_and_retag_images.sh

For convenience, you can use the following commands to download and execute the script:

```console
cd offline-keptn
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn/keptn/0.18.1/installer/airgapped/pull_and_retag_images.sh -o pull_and_retag_images.sh
chmod +x pull_and_retag_images.sh
KEPTN_TAG=0.18.1 ./pull_and_retag_images.sh "your-registry.localhost:5000/"
cd ..
```

Be sure to include the trailing slash for the registry url (e.g., `your-registry.localhost:5000/`).

**Installation**

Keptn's Helm chart allows you to specify the name of all images, which can be especially handy in air-gapped systems where you cannot access DockerHub for pulling the images.

A helper script for this is provided in our Git repository: https://github.com/keptn/keptn/blob/master/installer/airgapped/install_keptn.sh

For convenience, you can use the following commands to download and execute the script:

```console
cd offline-keptn
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn/keptn/0.18.1/installer/airgapped/install_keptn.sh -o install_keptn.sh
chmod +x install_keptn.sh
./install_keptn.sh "your-registry.localhost:5000/" keptn-0.18.1.tgz helm-service-0.18.1.tgz jmeter-service-0.18.1.tgz
cd ..
```

### Install Keptn using a Root-Context

The Helm Chart allows customizing the root-context for the Keptn API and Bridge.
By default, the Keptn API is located under `http://HOSTNAME/api` and the Keptn Bridge is located under `http://HOSTNAME/bridge`.
By specifying a value for `prefixPath`, the prefix used for the root-context can be configured.
For example, if a user sets `prefixPath=/mykeptn` in the Helm install/upgrade command,
the Keptn API is located under `http://HOSTNAME/mykeptn/api` and the Keptn Bridge is located under `http://HOSTNAME/mykeptn/bridge`:

```console
helm upgrade keptn keptn --install -n keptn --create-namespace --wait --version=0.18.1 --repo=https://charts.keptn.sh --set=apiGatewayNginx.type=LoadBalancer,continuousDelivery.enabled=true,prefixPath=/mykeptn
```

### Install Keptn with externally hosted MongoDB

If you want to use an externally hosted MongoDB instead of the MongoDB installed by Keptn, please use the `helm upgrade` command as shown below. Basically, provide the MongoDB host, port, user, and password in form of a connection string.

```console
helm upgrade keptn keptn --install -n keptn --create-namespace
--set=mongo.enabled=false,
      mongo.external.connectionString=<YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING>,
      mongo.auth.database=<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>
```

Keptn has no opinion on how to fine-tune the database connection. We recommend the user specify any special configuration via the connection string (docs [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/)) in the `mongo.external.connectionString` helm value.
