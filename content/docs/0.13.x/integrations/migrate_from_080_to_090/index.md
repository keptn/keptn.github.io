This guide will provide information for migrating an existing Keptn 0.8.x service to a Keptn 0.13.x service based on our Go package [keptn/go-utils](https://github.com/keptn/go-utils/) as well as our [keptn-service-template-go](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/keptn-service-template-go).
If you are using a different framework/programming language, please try to apply the changes described as best as you can.
