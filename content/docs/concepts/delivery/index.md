> **Challenge:** Today, many organizations build their continuous delivery workflows by hand and in an imperative way. This can lead to a lot of manual work when a scripted delivery pipeline - with slight modifications - is spread across the organization and re-used by different teams. Just imagine the difficulty to keep all variations of this pipeline up-to-date and to consider future changes in the delivery workflow of a new artifact. 

Keptn allows to declaratively define *multi-stage delivery* workflows by defining *what* needs to be done. *How* to achieve this delivery workflow is then left to other components and also here Keptn provides deployment services, which allow you to setup a multi-stage delivery workflow without a single line of pipeline code.

## Shipyard for Delivery Declaration

The definition is manifested in a so-called *shipyard* file that defines a delivery workflow. It can hold multiple stages, each with a dedicated *deployment strategy*, *test strategy*, as well as a *remediation strategy*. Following this declarative approach, there is no need to write imperative pipeline code. Keptn takes the shipyard file and creates a multi-stage workflow each stage having a deployment strategy (e.g., blue/green), testing strategy (e.g., functional tests or performance tests), and an optional automated remediation strategy for triggering self-healing actions. To learn more about a shipyard configuration, please continue [here](../../0.7.x/continuous_delivery/multi_stage/).

Please take a look at an example of a multi-stage delivery workflow with a *dev*, *hardening*, and *production* stage with blue/green deployment and automated problem remediation.  

```yaml
stages:
  - name: "dev"
    deployment_strategy: "direct"
    test_strategy: "functional"
  - name: "hardening"
    deployment_strategy: "blue_green_service"
    test_strategy: "performance"
  - name: "production"
    deployment_strategy: "blue_green_service"
    remediation_strategy: "automated"
```

According to the example, Keptn performs a direct deployment (i.e., replacing the previous version of a microservice with a new one) and triggers functional tests in the *dev* stage. In the *hardening* stage, Keptn performs a blue/green deployment (i.e., having two deployments at the same time but routing the traffic to only one) and triggers performance tests. Finally, the *production* stage even defines an automated remediation strategy to trigger counter actions to any issues detected by a monitoring system.
