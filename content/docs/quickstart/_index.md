### 2. Install Keptn

#### 2.1 Install the Keptn CLI
The Keptn CLI is the one-stop-shop for all operations related to Keptn.

##### 2.1.1 Automatic install of the Keptn CLI (Linux and Mac)
```console
curl -sL https://get.keptn.sh | sudo -E bash
```

This will download the *latest version*, unpack it and move it to `/usr/local/bin/keptn`.

##### 2.1.2 Manual install of the Keptn CLI
1. Download a release for your platform from the [release page](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/releases)
2. Unpack it
3. Run `keptn`


#### 3. Run the Keptn installer
Depending on the platform, Keptn install will prompt you different information needed to perform the installation.

```console
keptn install --platform=[aks|eks|gke|openshift|pks|kubernetes]
```

Keptn is now ready to be used.

### 4. Explore the usecases
