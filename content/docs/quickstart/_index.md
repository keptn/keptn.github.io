## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docker.com/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/) when running the demos in step 5

## Install Keptn

1. Create local k3d cluster. Therefore, you need to install [k3d](https://k3d.io) if not already present on your machine. You can skip this if k3d is already available on your machine.
    ```
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh | TAG=v4.4.4 bash
    ```

    Now, let's **start a cluster for Keptn**!
    ```
    k3d cluster create mykeptn -p "8082:80@agent[0]" --k3s-server-arg '--no-deploy=traefik' --k3s-server-arg "--kube-proxy-arg=conntrack-max-per-core=0"  --k3s-agent-arg "--kube-proxy-arg=conntrack-max-per-core=0" --agents 1
    ```

1. **Download and install the [Keptn CLI](../0.9.x/reference/cli)**

    ```
    curl -sL https://get.keptn.sh | bash
    ```

1. **Install Keptn** control-plane and execution-plane for continuous delivery use case

    ```
    keptn install --use-case=continuous-delivery
    ```

    Keptn comes with different installation options, please have a look at the [installation documentation](../0.9.x/operate) for more details on cluster requirements, resource consumption, supported Kubernetes versions, and more.

    <details><summary>Installation logs</summary>
    <p>The installation logs will print the following output:
    <pre>
    Installing Keptn ...
    Helm Chart used for Keptn installation: https://storage.googleapis.com/keptn-installer/keptn-0.9.0.tgz
    Start upgrading Helm Chart keptn in namespace keptn
    Finished upgrading Helm Chart keptn in namespace keptn
    Keptn control plane has been successfully set up on your cluster.
    Installing execution plane services for continuous-delivery use case.
    Start upgrading Helm Chart helm-service in namespace keptn
    Finished upgrading Helm Chart helm-service in namespace keptn
    Start upgrading Helm Chart jmeter-service in namespace keptn
    Finished upgrading Helm Chart jmeter-service in namespace keptn
    &nbsp;---------------------------------------------------
    &nbsp;* To quickly access Keptn, you can use a port-forward and then authenticate your Keptn CLI:
    &nbsp;- kubectl -n keptn port-forward service/api-gateway-nginx 8080:80
    &nbsp;- keptn auth --endpoint=http://localhost:8080/api --api-token=$(kubectl get secret keptn-api-token -n keptn -ojsonpath={.data.keptn-api-token} | base64 --decode)
    &nbsp;* Alternatively, follow the instructions provided at: https://keptn.sh/docs/0.8.x/operate/install/#authenticate-keptn-cli
    &nbsp;* To expose Keptn on a public endpoint, please continue with the installation guidelines provided at:
    &nbsp;- https://keptn.sh/docs/0.8.x/operate/install#install-keptn
    </pre>
    **There is no need to follow the instructions from the installation log - the quickstart guide will cover this!**
    </p>
    </details>

1. **Install and configure Istio** for Ingress + continuous delivery use-case
    ```
    curl -SL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn/keptn.github.io/master/content/docs/quickstart/exposeKeptnConfigureIstio.sh | bash
    ```


1. (Optional but recommended) **Create a demo project** with multi-stage pipeline + SLO-based quality gates
    ```
    curl -SL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn/keptn.github.io/master/content/docs/quickstart/get-demo.sh | bash
    ```

1. **Explore Keptn!** Please have a look at our [tutorials](https://tutorials.keptn.sh) and [documentation](../) to learn how you can use Keptn.

1. If you are finished exploring Keptn, you can always stop and start the cluster and delete it eventually.
    ```
    k3d cluster stop mykeptn
    k3d cluster start mykeptn
    ```

    Or delete it if you don't need it anymore
    ```
    k3d cluster delete mykeptn
    ```
