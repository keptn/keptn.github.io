## keptn trigger delivery

Triggers the delivery of a new artifact for a service in a project

### Synopsis

Triggers the delivery of a new artifact for a service in a project.
An "artifact" is the name of a Docker image which can be located at any Docker registry (e.g., DockerHub or Quay).
The new artifact is pushed in the first stage specified in the Shipyard of the project. Afterwards, Keptn takes care
of deploying the artifact to the other stages as well.

Note: The value provided in the --image flag has to contain the full qualified image name (incl. docker registry).
The only exception is "docker.io", as this is the default in Kubernetes.
For pulling an image from a private registry, we would like to refer to the Kubernetes documentation (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/).
