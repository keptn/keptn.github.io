## keptn uninstall

Uninstalls Keptn from a Kubernetes cluster

### Synopsis

Uninstalls Keptn from a Kubernetes cluster.

This command does *not* delete: 

* Dynatrace monitoring
* Prometheus monitoring
* Any (third-party) service installed in addition to Keptn (e.g., notification-service, slackbot-service, ...)

Besides, deployed services and the configuration on the Git upstream (i.e., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) are not deleted. To clean-up created projects and services, please see [Delete a project](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.8.x/manage/project/#delete-a-project).

**Note:** This command requires a *Kubernetes current context* pointing to the cluster where Keptn should get uninstalled from.


```
keptn uninstall [flags]
