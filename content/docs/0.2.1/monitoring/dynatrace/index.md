In order to evaluate the quality gates, we have to set up monitoring to provide the needed data.

## Setup Dynatrace

1. Get your Dynatrace Tenant

    If you don't have a Dynatrace tenant yet, sign up for a [free trial](https://www.dynatrace.com/trial/) or a [developer account](https://www.dynatrace.com/developer/).

    **Please note** that if you bring your own tenant, the current version of keptn only supports Dynatrace SaaS tenants. Support for Dynatrace Managed is planned for future releases.

1. Create a Dynatrace API Token

    Log in to your Dynatrace tenant, and go to **Settings > Integration > Dynatrace API**. Then, create a new API Token with the following permissions:

    - Access problem and event feed, metrics and topology
    - Access logs
    - Configure maintenance windows
    - Read configuration
    - Write configuration
    - Capture request data
    - Real user monitoring JavaScript tag management

1. Create a Dynatrace PaaS Token

    In your Dynatrace tenant, go to **Settings > Integration > Platform as a Service**, and create a new PaaS Token.

1. Start the following script:
  ```console
  $ ./defineDynatraceCredentials.sh
  ```

1. Execute the installation script:
  ```console
  $ ./deployDynatrace.sh
  ```

When this script is finished, the Dynatrace OneAgent will be deployed in your cluster.

  **Note 1:** To see the services running in your cluster, make sure to restart the pods they are running in.
  ```
  kubectl delete pods --all -n keptn
  ```

  **Note 2:** If the nodes in your cluster run on *Container-Optimized OS (cos)*, make sure to [follow the instructions](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/cloud-platforms/google-cloud-platform/google-kubernetes-engine/deploy-oneagent-on-google-kubernetes-engine-clusters/#expand-134parameter-for-container-optimized-os-early-access) for setting up the Dynatrace OneAgent Operator. This means that after the initial setup with `deployDynatrace.sh`, which is a step below, the `cr.yml` has to be edited and applied again. In addition, all pods have to be restarted.


## Configure Jenkins

1. Go to Jenkins at `http://jenkins.keptn.<EXTERNAL_IP>.xip.io/` and login with the default credentials `admin` / `AiTx4u8VyUV8tCKk` or with the updated credentials you set after the installation. You can retrieve the URL of Jenkins with the following command:
  ```
  echo http://jenkins.keptn.$(kubectl describe svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system | grep "LoadBalancer Ingress:" | sed 's~LoadBalancer Ingress:[ \t]*~~').xip.io/configure
  ``` 
  
1. In the **Jenkins** > **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System** screen, scroll to the environment variables and **Add** two new environment variables:
    - DT_TENANT_URL with the Dynatrace tenant URL as value 
    - DT_API_TOKEN with the Dynatrace API token as value

## (Optional) Create process group naming rule in Dynatrace

1. Create a naming rule for process groups
    1. Go to **Settings**, **Process and containers**, and click on **Process group naming**.
    1. Create a new process group naming rule with **Add new rule**.
    1. Edit that rule:
        * Rule name: `Container.Namespace`
        * Process group name format: `{ProcessGroup:KubernetesContainerName}.{ProcessGroup:KubernetesNamespace}`
        * Condition: `Kubernetes namespace`> `exits`
    1. Click on **Preview** and **Save**.

    Screenshot shows this rule definition.
