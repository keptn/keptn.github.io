## keptn auth

Authenticates the Keptn CLI against a Keptn installation

### Synopsis

Authenticates the Keptn CLI against a Keptn installation using an endpoint and an API token. 
The endpoint and API token are automatically configured during the Keptn installation.
If the authentication is successful, the endpoint and the API token are stored in a password store of the underlying operating system.
More precisely, the Keptn CLI stores the endpoint and API token using *pass* in case of Linux, using *Keychain* in case of macOS, or *Wincred* in case of Windows.

**Note:** If you receive a warning *Using a file-based storage for the key because the password-store seems to be not set up.* this is because a password store could not be found in your environment. In this case, the credentials are stored in *~/.keptn/.keptn* in your home directory.
	

```
keptn auth --endpoint=https://api.keptn.MY.DOMAIN.COM --api-token=SECRET_TOKEN [flags]
