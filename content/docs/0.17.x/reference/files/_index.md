Keptn configurations are most commonly defined in YAML files
which are created on your local system then installed into your Keptn configuration with a specific command.
This writes the configuration to you [upstream Git repo](../../manage/git_upstream),
where Keptn accesses the configuration.

The YAML syntax is generally easy to follow but be aware that the indentation is precise and important.
For more information about YAML syntax,
see the Fileformat [YAML](https://docs.fileformat.com/programming/yaml/) document.
