Depending on the monitoring solution you have in place and the SLIs you have configured for your services,
you need to deploy the corresponding SLI-provider.
In Keptn 0.17.x, integrations are provided for *Dynatrace*, *Prometheus*, and *Datadog*.

Follow the instructions in the documentation for the Integration
you are using as your SLI provider
to configure Keptn to use the appropriate SLIs for your project:

* [Dynatrace](https://artifacthub.io/packages/keptn/keptn-integrations/dynatrace-service)

* [Prometheus](https://artifacthub.io/packages/keptn/keptn-integrations/prometheus-service)

* [Datadog](https://artifacthub.io/packages/keptn/keptn-integrations/datadog-service)

## Add custom SLI-Provider

* To create and add your custom SLI-provider to Keptn, please follow the instructions [here](../../integrations/sli_provider).
