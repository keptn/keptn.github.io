In order to evaluate the quality gates, we have to set up monitoring to provide the needed data.

1. Checkout the needed files.

    - If you have not yet onboarded the carts service, please execute the following commands to receive the needed files:
    
    ```
    git clone --branch 0.2.0 https://github.com/keptn/examples.git --single-branch
    cd ./examples/monitoring/prometheus
    ```

    - If you already have [onboarded the carts service](../../usecases/onboard-carts-service/), navigate to the directory `monitoring/prometheus`. 

1. In this directory, you will find a script called `deployPrometheus.sh`. This script will deploy Prometheus in the namespace `monitoring` and set up scrape job configurations for monitoring the carts service in the `dev`, `staging`, and `production` namespace. Execute that script by calling:

  ```console
  ./deployPrometheus.sh
  ```

  ```console
  namespace "monitoring" created
  configmap "prometheus-server-conf" created
  clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "prometheus" created
  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "prometheus" created
  deployment.extensions "prometheus-deployment" created
  service "prometheus-service" created
  ```

To verify the Prometheus installation, you can browse to the Prometheus web interface:

1. Enable port-forwarding for the `prometheus-service`:

  ```console
  kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-service 8080 -n monitoring
  ```

1. Open the URL [localhost:8080/targets](http://localhost:8080/targets) in your browser. Here you should see three targets for the carts service:

    Please note that if you have not onboarded the carts service yet, the Prometheus dashboard will report _down_ in the state column.
