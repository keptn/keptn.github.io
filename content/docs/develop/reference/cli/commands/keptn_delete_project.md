## keptn delete project

Deletes a project identified by project name

### Synopsis

Deletes a project identified by project name. 

**Known Limitations**:

* If a Git upstream is configured for this project, the referenced upstream repository (e.g., on GitHub) will not be deleted. 
* Services that have been deployed to the Kubernetes cluster are not deleted (same goes for the namespaces).
* Helm-releases created for deployments are not deleted - see https://keptn.sh/docs/develop/reference/helm/#clean-up-after-deleting-a-project
