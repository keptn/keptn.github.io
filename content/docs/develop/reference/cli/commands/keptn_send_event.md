## keptn send event

Sends a Keptn event

### Synopsis

Allows to send an arbitrary Keptn event that is defined in the provided JSON file.
An event has to follow the Cloud Events specification (https://cloudevents.io/) in version 0.2 and has to be written in JSON.
In addition, the payload of the Cloud Event needs to follow the Keptn spec (https://github.com/keptn/spec/blob/0.1.3/cloudevents.md).

For convenience, this command offers the *--stream-websocket* flag to open a web socket communication to Keptn. Consequently, messages from the receiving Keptn service, which processes the event, are sent to the CLI via WebSocket.
	

```
keptn send event --file=FILEPATH --stream-websocket [flags]
```

### Examples

```
keptn send event --file=./new_artifact_event.json --stream-websocket
```

### Options

```
  -f, --file string   The file containing the event as Cloud Event in JSON.
  -h, --help          help for event
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --mock                 mocking of server communication - ATTENTION: your commands will not be sent to the keptn server
  -q, --quiet                suppress debug and info output
      --suppress-websocket   disables websocket communication - use the ID of Keptn context (if provided) for checking the result of your command
  -v, --verbose              verbose logging
```
