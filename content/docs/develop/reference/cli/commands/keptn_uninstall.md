## keptn uninstall

Uninstalls Keptn from a Kubernetes cluster

### Synopsis

Uninstalls Keptn from a Kubernetes cluster.

This command does *not* delete: 

* Istio
* Dynatrace monitoring
* Prometheus monitoring
* Any (third-party) service installed in addition to Keptn (e.g., notification-service, slackbot-service, ...)

Besides, deployed services and the configuration on the Git upstream (i.e., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) are not deleted. To clean-up created projects and services, instructions are provided [here](../../manage/project#delete-a-project).

**Note:** This command requires a *kubernetes current context* pointing to the cluster where Keptn should get uninstalled.


```
keptn uninstall [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  -h, --help                       help for uninstall
