Demonstrates how to use the self-healing mechanisms of Keptn to solve a problem in a production stage by providing automated upscaling.

## About this tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the capabilities of Keptn to provide self-healing for an application without modifying code. The following tutorial will scale up the pods of an application if the application undergoes heavy CPU saturation. 

## Prerequisites

- See [Self-healing](../#prerequisites).

## Configure monitoring

To inform Keptn about any issues in a production environment, monitoring has to be set up. The Keptn CLI helps with the automated setup and configuration of Prometheus as the monitoring solution running in the Kubernetes cluster. 

To add these files to Keptn and to automatically configure Prometheus, execute the following commands:

1. Make sure you are in the correct folder of your examples directory:

    ```
    cd examples/onboarding-carts
    ```

1. Tell the Prometheus service how to retrieve the SLI value you would like to inspect:

    ```
    keptn add-resource --project=sockshop --stage=production --service=carts --resource=sli-config-prometheus.yaml --resourceUri=prometheus/sli.yaml
    ```

1. Configure remediation actions for up-scaling based on Prometheus alerts:

    ```console
    keptn add-resource --project=sockshop --stage=production --service=carts --resource=remediation.yaml --resourceUri=remediation.yaml
    ```

1. Configure Prometheus with the Keptn CLI (this configures the [Alert Manager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/) based on the slo.yaml file):

    ```console
    keptn configure monitoring prometheus --project=sockshop --service=carts
    ```

- `remediation.yaml`

  ```yaml
  remediations:
  - name: response_time_p90
    actions:
    - action: scaling
      value: +1
  - name: Response time degradation
    actions:
    - action: scaling
      value: +1
  ```

</details>

## Run the tutorial

### Generate load for the service

To simulate user traffic that is causing an unhealthy behavior in the carts service, please execute the following script. This will add special items into the shopping cart that cause some extensive calculation.

1. Move to the correct folder:

    ```console
    cd ../load-generation/bin
    ```

1. Start the load generation script depending on your OS (replace \_OS\_ with linux, mac, or win):

    ```console
    ./loadgenerator-_OS_ "http://carts.sockshop-production.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')" cpu
    ```

1. (optional:) Verify the load in Prometheus.
    - Make a port forward to access Prometheus:

    ```console
    kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-service -n monitoring 8080:8080
    ```
    
    - Access Prometheus from your browser on http://localhost:8080.

    - In the **Graph** tab, add the expression 

    ```console
    histogram_quantile(0.9, sum by(le) (rate(http_response_time_milliseconds_bucket{job="carts-sockshop-production"}[3m])))
    ```
    
    - Select the **Graph** tab to see your Response time metrics of the `carts` service in the `sockshop-production` environment.

    - You should see a graph which locks similar to this:

    {{< popup_image
        link="./assets/prometheus-load.png"
        caption="Prometheus load"
        width="700px">}}

### Watch self-healing in action

After approximately 10-15 minutes, the *Alert Manager* will send out an alert since the service level objective is not met anymore. 

1. To verify that an alert was fired, select the *Alerts* view where you should see that the alert `response_time_p90` is in the `firing` state:

    {{< popup_image
        link="./assets/alert-manager.png"
        caption="Alert manager"
        width="700px">}}

After receiving the problem notification, the *prometheus-service* will translate it into a Keptn CloudEvent. This event will eventually be received by the *remediation-service* that will look for a remediation action specified for this type of problem and, if found, execute it.

In this tutorial, the number of pods will be increased to remediate the issue of the response time increase. 

1. Check the executed remediation actions by executing:

    ```console
    kubectl get deployments -n sockshop-production
    ```

    You can see that the `carts-primary` deployment is now served by two pods:

    ```console
    NAME             DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    carts-db         1         1         1            1           37m
    carts-primary    2         2         2            2           32m
    ```

1. Also you should see an additional pod running when you execute:

    ```console
    kubectl get pods -n sockshop-production
    ```

    ```console
    NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    carts-db-57cd95557b-r6cg8         1/1     Running   0          38m
    carts-primary-7c96d87df9-75pg7    2/2     Running   0          33m
    carts-primary-7c96d87df9-78fh2    2/2     Running   0          5m
    ```

1. To get an overview of the actions that got triggered by the response time SLO violation, you can use the Keptn's Bridge. You can access it by a port-forward from your local machine to the Kubernetes cluster:

    ```console 
    kubectl port-forward svc/bridge -n keptn 9000:8080
    ```

    Now, access the bridge from your browser on http://localhost:9000. 

    In this example, the bridge shows that the remediation service triggered an update of the configuration of the carts service by increasing the number of replicas to 2. When the additional replica was available, the wait-service waited for ten minutes for the remediation action to take effect. Afterwards, an evaluation by the lighthouse-service was triggered to check if the remediation action resolved the problem. In this case, increasing the number of replicas achieved the desired effect, since the evaluation of the service level objectives has been successful.

1. Furthermore, you can use Prometheus to double-check the response time:
