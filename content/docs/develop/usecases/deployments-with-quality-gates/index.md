This use case gives an overview of deployments using quality gates and blue/green deployments of a new service version.

## About this use case

When developing an application, sooner or later you need to update a service in a `production` environment. To conduct this in a controlled manner and without impacting end-user experience, the quality of the new service has to be ensured and adequate deployment strategies must be in place. For example, blue-green deployments are well-known strategies to roll out a new service version by also keeping the previous service version available if something goes wrong.

For this use case, we prepared a *slow* and a *regular* version of the carts service:

| Image                                 | Description                                        |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| docker.io/keptnexamples/carts:0.8.2   | Processes each request with a slowdown of 1 second |
| docker.io/keptnexamples/carts:0.8.3   | Processes each request without any slowdown        |

In this use case, we will try to deploy these two versions.
During this deployment process, the versions have to pass a quality gate
in the `staging` environment in order to get promoted to the `production` environment.
This quality gate checks whether the average response time of the service is under 1&nbsp;second. If the response time exceeds this threshold, the performance evaluation will be marked as failed.

In overview, we will conduct these two scenarios:

First, we will *try* to deploy the *slow* version of the carts service. Therefore, keptn will deploy this new version into the `dev` environment where functional tests will be executed. After passing these functional tests, keptn will promote this service into the `staging` environment by releasing it as the blue or green version next to the previous version of the service. Then, keptn will route traffic to this new version by changing the configuration of the virtual service (i.e., by setting weights for the routes between blue and green) and keptn will start the defined performance test. Using the monitoring results of this performance test will allow [Pitometer](https://github.com/keptn/pitometer) to evaluate the quality gate. This *slow* version will not pass the quality gate and, hence, the deployment will be rejected. Furthermore, keptn will direct the requests to the service to the previous working deployment of the service. 

Second, we will deploy the *regular* version of the carts service. Therefore, keptn will conduct the same steps as before except that this version will now pass the quality gate. Hence, this *regular* version will be promoted into the `production` environment.


## Prerequisites
In this use case, we will be using either the open source monitoring solution *Prometheus* or *Dynatrace*.

1. Either [Prometheus](../../monitoring/prometheus) or [Dynatrace](../../monitoring/dynatrace) monitoring set up.

1. In order to start this use case, please deploy the `carts` service by completing the use case [Onboarding a Service](../onboard-carts-service/).

## Set up of monitoring for the carts service
Since this use case relies on the concept of quality gates, you will need to set up monitoring for your carts service.
The [Pitometer](https://github.com/keptn/pitometer) service will then evaluate the data coming from the monitoring solution to determine a score for the quality gate.

For using the quality gate, Pitometer requires a performance specification.
This performance specification has to be located in a repository having the name of 
your service (for this use case `carts`) in the configured GitHub organization (i.e. used in [keptn configure](../../reference/cli/#keptn-configure)).


### Option 1: Prometheus
<details><summary>Expand instructions</summary>
<p>
Please make sure you have followed the instructions for setting up [Prometheus](../../monitoring/prometheus).

To set up the quality gates for the carts service, please navigate to the `perfspec` folder of your carts service. This folder contains files defining the quality gate that will be evaluated against Prometheus. 

1. Make sure you are in the `carts` folder.
1. Rename the file `perfspec_prometheus.json` to `perfspec.json`. 
1. Commit and push the file.

  ```console
  git add .
  git commit -m "use prometheus perfspec"
  git push
  ```

Now, you have quality gates in place, which will check whether the average response time of the service is under 1&nbsp;second.

### Option 2: Dynatrace
<details><summary>Expand instructions</summary>
<p>
Please make sure you have followed the instructions for setting up [Dynatrace](../../monitoring/dynatrace).

To set up the quality gates for the carts service, please navigate to the `perfspec` folder of your carts service. This file contains the quality gate that will be evaluated against Dynatrace. 

1. Make sure you are in the `carts` folder.
1. Rename the file `perfspec_dynatrace.json` to `perfspec.json`. 
1. Commit and push the file.

  ```console
  git add .
  git commit -m "use dynatrace perfspec"
  git push
  ```

Now, you have quality gates in place, which will check whether the average response time of the service is under 1&nbsp;second.

## View carts service

- Run the following command to get the **EXTERNAL-IP** and **PORT** of your cluster's ingress gateway.
    
  ```console    
  kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
  ```

  ```console
  NAME                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)
  istio-ingressgateway     LoadBalancer   10.11.246.127   <EXTERNAL_IP>   80:32399/TCP 
  ```

- Navigate to `http://carts.sockshop-production.<EXTERNAL IP>.xip.io` for viewing the carts service in your `production` environment. 


## Try to deploy the slow carts version

1. Use the keptn CLI to send a version of the `carts` artifact, which contains an artificial
slowdown of 1 second in each request. 
  ```console
  keptn send event new-artifact --project=sockshop --service=carts --image=docker.io/keptnexamples/carts --tag=0.8.2
  ```

1. This automatically changes the configuration of the service and automatically triggers the following services:
  * **Phase 1**: Deploying, testing and evaluating the test in the `dev` stage:
      * **helm-service**: This service deploys the new artifact to `dev`.
      * **jmeter-service**: This service runs a basic health check and a functional check in `dev`. Afterwards, this service sends an event of type `sh.keptn.events.tests-finished`. 
      * **pitometer-service**: This service picks up the event and evaluates the test runs based on the  performance signature specified earlier in the `perfspec.json` file. Since in the `dev` environment, only functional tests are executed, the pitometer-service will mark the test run as successful (functional failures would have been detected by the **jmeter-service**).
      * **gatekeeper-service**: This service promotes the artifact to the next stage, i.e., `staging`.
  * **Phase 2**: Deploying, testing and evaluating the test in the `staging` stage:
      * **helm-service**: This service deploys the new artifact to `staging` using a blue/green deployment strategy.
      * **jmeter-service**: This service runs a performance test in `staging` and sends the `sh.keptn.events.tests-finished` event.
      * **pitometer-service**: This service picks up the event and this time, the quality gates of the service will be evaluated because we are using the performance-tests strategy for this stage. This means that the pitometer-service will fetch the metrics for the `carts` service from either Prometheus or Dynatrace, depending on how you set up the monitoring for your service earlier. Based on the results of that evaluation, the pitometer-service will mark the test run execution as successful or failed. In our scenario, the pitometer-service will mark it as failed since the response time thresholds will be exceeded.
      * **gatekeeper-service**: This service receives a `sh.keptn.events.evaluation-done` event, which contains the result of the evaluaton of the pitometer-service. Since in this case the performance test run failed, the gatekeeper-service automatically re-routes traffic to the previous colored blue or green version in `staging` and the artifact won't be promoted to `production`.
      
  **Outcome**: This slow version is **not** promoted to the `production` namespace because of the active quality gate in place.
For verifying this, open a browser and navigate to `http://carts.sockshop-production.EXTERNAL-IP.xip.io/version`.
Here, you see that the version of the carts service has not changed.

## Deploy the regular carts version

1. Use the keptn CLI to send a new version of the `carts` artifact, which does **not** contain any slowdown.
  ```console
  keptn send event new-artifact --project=sockshop --service=carts --image=docker.io/keptnexamples/carts --tag=0.8.3
  ```

1. This automatically changes the configuration of the service and automatically triggers the deployment.

1. In this case, the quality gate is passed and the service gets deployed in the `production` namespace. 

1. To verify the deployment in `production`, open a browser an navigate to `http://carts.sockshop-production.EXTERNAL-IP.xip.io/version`. As a result, you see `Version: v3`.

1. Besides, you can verify the deployments in your Kubernetes cluster using the following commands: 

    ```console
    kubectl get deployments -n sockshop-production
    ``` 

    ```console
