## Enabling interoperability in CI/CD on the example of Tekton + Keptn
| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Enabling interoperability in CI/CD** with Mauricio Salatino, VMware<br><br> Mauricio Salatino joins us at this Keptn User Group meeting to present how interoperability between CI/CD systems can be achieved by defining a common language based on cloud events. He will demo a PoC that allows to bridge the gap between different CI/CD systems on the example of Tekton and Keptn and make them interact with each other on a common set of events that both systems are able to interpret and act upon. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YojRJJvN4N8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |


## Automating performance and load tests with Artillery + Keptn

| **Automating & evaluating load testing with Locust and Keptn** with Francesco Lentini, Artillery<br><br> Francesco Lentini from Artillery shows how you can use Artillery to run load tests and smoke tests to help your services maintain their SLOs. <br><br>[Find the integration in the Keptn Sandbox](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/artillery-service). | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1Spkw0faq0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |


## Automating & evaluating load testing with Locust and Keptn

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Automating & evaluating load testing with Locust and Keptn** with Lars Holmberg, RedShirt<br><br> Learn how to use Locust load testing and how to write powerful load tests in a simple way. We will then use Keptn to have the tests automatically executed as part of our CD and Keptn Quality Gates to evaluate the impact of the tests on our applications. We even build a self-service platform for developers to be able to trigger deployment, tests, and evaluations for new version of their applications. <br><br>[Find the integration in the Keptn Sandbox](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/locust-service). | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ok4x2LIbEEY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |


## Automating Quality Gates in Azure DevOps with Keptn

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Automating Quality Gates in Azure DevOps with Keptn** with Bert van der Heyden, RealDolmen<br><br> Azure DevOps is a popular choice for many organizations to automate continuous delivery of enterprise and cloud native applications. In this Keptn webinar we have Bert Van der Heyden, Performance Engineer at RealDolmen and creator of the Azure DevOps Keptn Extensions, walking us through the use case of integrating Keptn's SLI/SLO-based Quality Gates into Azure DevOps pipelines in order to automate the build validation and approval process.<br><br>[Find the integration in the Keptn Sandbox](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/keptn-azure-devops-extension). | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgCizWLVsPc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |

## Evaluating the resiliency of your microservices with LitmusChaos tests and Keptn

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Evaluating the resiliency of your microservices with LitmusChaos tests and Keptn** with Karthik S, LitmusChaos<br><br> Chaos Engineering is the new entrant into the delivery pipeline of cloud-native applications, and a proven means of ascertaining SLO compliance and evaluating the resilience of applications. This assumes even more importance given the en-masse migration that organizations are making to Kubernetes as the development & deployment platform of choice. LitmusChaos is a cloud-native chaos engineering framework that provides a rich suite of chaos experiments and the ability to orchestrate chaos as defined by the principles of chaos. In this webinar, we will view how Keptn's litmus service triggers chaos on applications under load as part of its powerful automated CD pipeline, thereby evaluating application resilience and strengthening the quality gate evaluation process.<br><br>[Find the integration in the Keptn Sandbox](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/locust-service).  | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aa5SzQmv4EQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |

## Manage Keptn with a Slackbot

| **Manage Keptn with a Slackbot** with Nestor Zapata and Zohaib Ul-Hassan, Citrix<br><br> Learn how to use our Slackbot to get answers from Keptn and also to trigger tests and quality gate evaluation with all results directly delivered to Slack! No need to ever leave one of your favorite tools again.<br><br>[Find the integration in the Keptn Sandbox](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/slackbot-service).  | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_uJkwapoDuo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |

## Performance as a self service with Keptn and Neoload
| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Performance as a self service with Keptn and Neoload** with Henrik Rexed, Neotys<br><br> Organizations are moving to cloud-native platforms and more loosely coupled architectures. When done right, it improves the developer experience and increases overall productivity as developers can do most things (build, deploy, run) as a self-service. Continuous performance feedback is a crucial capability of a modern cloud-native platform. It requires the traditional Performance Center of Excellence teams to automate their testing and analysis tasks and provide it as a built-in self-service platform capability as the conventional approaches donâ€™t scale any longer.<br><br>[Find the integration in the Keptn Contrib repository](https://github.com/keptn-contrib/neoload-service). | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_s2EcAq1RSE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |
