| **Level-Up your Jenkins-based Delivery with Keptn** with Andi Grabner<br><br> Want to level-up your Jenkins Pipelines with Keptn? In this webinar we show you how to "Automate Build Approvals through SLI/SLO based Quality Gates" and how to "Enable a Performance-Driven Culture through Performance as a Self-Service". | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VYRdirdjOAg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |

## Putting Chaos into Continuous Delivery - how to increase the resilience of your applications

| **Putting Chaos into Continuous Delivery - how to increase the resilience of your applications** with Jürgen Etzlstorfer<br><br>We will discuss how you can construct continuous delivery pipelines that include chaos experimentation while simulating real-world load to test the resilience of applications. On top, we implement quality gates based on SLOs to ensure resilient applications are deployed into production. Continuous Delivery practices have evolved significantly with the cloud-native paradigm. GitOps & Chaos Engineering are at the forefront of this new CD approach, with an ever-increasing pattern involving Git-backed pipeline definitions that implement “chaos stages” in pre-prod environments to gauge SLO compliance. In this talk, we will discuss how you can construct pipelines that include chaos experimentation (mapped to declarative hypothesis around application steady-state) while simulating real-world load and implement quality gates to ensure resilient applications are deployed into production. All this - in a GitOps native manner. We will also demonstrate how you can include chaos tests to your existing CD pipelines without the need of rewriting them. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7THMrIGKO4?start=166" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |

## Keptn-in-a-box - delivering the Autonomous Cloud out of the box

| **Keptn-in-a-box - delivering the Autonomous Cloud out of the box** with Sergio Hinojosa, Dynatrace<br><br> Keptn-In-A-Box is part of the automation for delivering Autonomous Cloud Workshops with Dynatrace. This is not a tutorial but more an explanation of what the shell file set up for you on a plain Ubuntu image. A simple Bash script will set-up a fully functional Single Node Kubernetes Cluster with Dynatrace installed and Kubernetes Cluster, Cloud Applications, and Events monitoring enabled. This script is used as userdata when spinning up elastic compute images (ec2) in amazon web services, but it can run also manually in a Linux machine or VM with snap installed. The tested distro is Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS For spinning up instances automatically with AWS completely configured and set up, and also automating the creation and management of Dynatrace environments.<br><br>[Try it yourself](https://tutorials.keptn.sh) in our tutorials. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9ZYdih0anE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |
