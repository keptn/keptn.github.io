| [**Event-Driven DevOps with Keptn: The End of the Monolithic Delivery Pipeline!**](<https://cdeliveryfdn.buzzsprout.com/1008697/4231295-event-driven-devops-with-keptn-the-end-of-the-monolithic-delivery-pipeline>)<br>While software architects have broken their monoliths into event-driven service architectures, many pipeline architects still try to apply a monolithic pipeline approach to deliver these new architectures. This results in constantly outdated pipeline code, tight integration of process and tools, lengthy diagnostics sessions to fix broken pipelines and puts strains on the underlying resources that build, deploy, test and validate. In this workshop we introduce a new approach: Event-based Continuous Delivery which decouples the declaration of processes from tooling. It uses a “everything as code” approach which includes deployment, testing, quality gate, observability and promotion definitions. One open source project which implements this new approach is Keptn. Listen to this episode to learn more.<br><br>https://cdeliveryfdn.buzzsprout.com/1008697/4231295-event-driven-devops-with-keptn-the-end-of-the-monolithic-delivery-pipeline | <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2BgNQBoBiMP41rxUQrYhci" width="500" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe> |
| [**Kubernetes Podcast from Google: Keptn, with Alois Reitbauer**](<https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/119-keptn/>)<br>Keptn, a control plane for continuous delivery, came out of the need to install Dynatrace’s software at their customer’s environments. Alois Reitbauer is Chief Technical Strategist at Dynatrace, reponsible for open source, and a co-chair of the CNCF App Delivery SIG. He talks to your hosts about Keptn, observability after deployment, and how owning a 40 year old sports car is more “curation” than “operation”.<br><br>https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/119-keptn/ | <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2aujvK9AchmaZi1G4AOtoi" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe> |
